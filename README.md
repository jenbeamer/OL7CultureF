# OpenForPrePrints

My inital vision statement

 Iâ€™m working with Faculty and students on the 7 Claremont Campuses to educate them about putting their scholarly works (PrePrints) and research into openly accessible venues rather than subscription and paid databases so that they share their work and provide the information to the communities who need access to the information, it's not locked away in a university library.
